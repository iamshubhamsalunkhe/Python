# pop deletes a particular value using indexing
# remove deletes a particular value using actual value
# del is similar to pop except it can delete sequence of values using indexing

# 51.	Write difference between sorted and sort
# sort will update the list you are working on
# sorted will not update the list, instead we can create another list and put the sorted values of the current list in the new list without changing the current list.

# 52.	Write difference between sort and reverse
# sort will sort the list in ascending order
# reverse will reverse the sequence of values. for eg the last value will be first, secondlast will be second and so on.
